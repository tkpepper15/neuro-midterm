Neuro-ophthalmology is an interdesciplinary field that quite literally merges neurology with ophtamology. It emphasizes the study of disorders affecting the visual system, particularly those related to the brain and the nerves that control eye movements. 

## Anatomy
The eye-brain connection involves complex pathways where visual information captured by the eye is transmitted via the optic nerve to the brain's visual processing centers. This connection enables the brain to interpret and make sense of visual stimuli, supporting our ability to perceive and interact with the surrounding environment.

      <ul>
        <li>Cornea: The transparent front part of the eye that refracts light onto the lens.</li>
        <li>Lens: Focuses light onto the retina at the back of the eye.</li>
        <li>Retina: Contains photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) that convert light into neural signals.</li>
        <li>Optic Nerve: Transmits visual information from the retina to the brain.</li>
        <li>Extraocular Muscles: Muscles that control eye movements, including the superior rectus, inferior rectus, lateral rectus, medial rectus, superior oblique, and inferior oblique muscles.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Optic Nerve: Composed of axons from retinal ganglion cells, carries visual information from each eye to the brain.</li>
        <li>Optic Chiasm: The point where fibers from the nasal (medial) halves of the retinas cross to the opposite side, while fibers from the temporal (lateral) halves remain on the same side.</li>
        <li>Optic Tracts: Carry visual information from the optic chiasm to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus.</li>
        <li>Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN): Relay center in the thalamus that processes visual information before sending it to the visual cortex.</li>

        <li>Superior Colliculus: Involved in orienting eye movements and visual attention.</li>

## Pathology
Unfortunately, millions of people around the world suffer from neuro-visual disorders. Prevalent conditions are described below:

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-title" data-toggle="accordion-content">Cranial Nerve Abnormalities</div>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Cranial nerve abnormalities affecting the eye muscles can result in strabismus, ptosis (drooping eyelid), or abnormal pupil responses, depending on the specific nerve affected. These abnormalities may also lead to difficulties in controlling eye movements and coordinating binocular vision.</p>
        <p>Most commonly, the abducens nerve, also referred to as cranial nerve six (CN VI) is impinged. It plays a role in controlling the eye's extraocular motor functions, alongside the oculomotor nerve (CN III) and the trochlear nerve (CN IV). Thus, its malfunction can result in hindered eye movement.</p>
