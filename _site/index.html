    <p>Millions of people around the world suffer from neuro-visual disordersâ€”hindered nerves in and around the eye. A few of the most prevalent conditions are explained below:</p>

<h2 id="optic-neuritis">Optic Neuritis</h2>

<p>This condition involves inflammation of the optic nerve, which can cause sudden vision loss, often accompanied by eye pain that worsens with eye movement. Optic neuritis is commonly associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) but can also occur due to other causes.</p>

<h2 id="papilledema">Papilledema</h2>

<p>Papilledema is the swelling of the optic disc, usually due to increased intracranial pressure. It can lead to vision problems, especially peripheral vision loss, and is often a sign of an underlying condition such as a brain tumor, hydrocephalus, or intracranial hypertension.</p>

<h2 id="ischemic-optic-neuropathy">Ischemic Optic Neuropathy</h2>

<p>This condition results from inadequate blood flow to the optic nerve, leading to sudden or gradual vision loss. There are two main types: anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION), which affects the front portion of the optic nerve, and posterior ischemic optic neuropathy (PION), which affects the back portion. Ischemic optic neuropathy can be associated with systemic conditions like diabetes, hypertension, or giant cell arteritis.</p>

<h2 id="visual-field-defects">Visual Field Defects</h2>

<p>Various neurologic conditions can cause visual field defects, which refer to areas of vision loss or reduced vision in the visual field. Conditions like strokes, brain tumors, and traumatic brain injuries can lead to specific patterns of visual field defects depending on the location and extent of the damage to the visual pathways.</p>

<h2 id="nystagmus">Nystagmus</h2>

<p>Nystagmus is an involuntary rhythmic movement of the eyes, which can result in impaired vision and difficulties with focusing. It can be congenital (present from birth) or acquired due to neurological conditions, medications, or inner ear problems.</p>

<h2 id="ocular-motor-disorders">Ocular Motor Disorders</h2>

<p>These disorders affect eye movements and coordination, leading to symptoms such as double vision (diplopia), difficulty tracking moving objects, or misalignment of the eyes (strabismus). Conditions like internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), cranial nerve palsies, and disorders of the vestibular system can cause ocular motor abnormalities.</p>

<h2 id="cortical-visual-impairment-cvi">Cortical Visual Impairment (CVI)</h2>

<p>CVI refers to vision problems caused by damage or dysfunction in the visual processing areas of the brain, such as the occipital lobes. Individuals with CVI may have difficulty interpreting visual information, recognizing objects or faces, and navigating their environment visually, despite having structurally intact eyes.</p>
